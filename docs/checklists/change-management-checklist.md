# Change Management Checklist

Use this checklist to assess, approve, and implement changes with minimal risk.

- Capture change request with context, scope, risk, and success criteria.
- Perform impact analysis (schedule, cost, quality, security, compliance, operations).
- Identify affected components, teams, environments, and dependencies.
- Obtain approvals (Change Control Board (CCB)/PM/PO as applicable) with go/no-go criteria and rollback plan.
- Update plans: backlog, schedule, test plan, deployment plan, comms plan.
- Communicate stakeholder impacts and timelines; publish a change notice.
- Schedule change window; confirm environment readiness and backups.
- Execute change with monitoring/observability enabled.
- Validate outcomes against success criteria; perform smoke/regression tests.
- If needed, execute rollback per plan and document deviations.
- Close change: update change log, link artifacts (tickets/PRs/ADRs), and capture lessons learned.
