# QA Strategy and Coverage Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure quality is planned and measured throughout delivery.

- Define quality objectives and acceptance/exit criteria.
- Establish test levels and scope: unit, component, integration, E2E, performance, security, accessibility.
- Create/maintain traceability from requirements to tests and defects.
- Define automation strategy: what to automate, target coverage, pipeline gates.
- Prepare environments and data management strategy; align with DevOps on stability.
- Define defect triage cadence, SLAs, and severity/priority scheme.
- Set up reporting/dashboards for pass rate, defect trends, MTTR, escape rate.
- Agree on release readiness criteria and sign-off responsibilities.
- Include non-functional testing plans (perf/load, security scanning, usability, resilience).
- Retrospect quality outcomes every iteration/release and feed insights into backlog.
