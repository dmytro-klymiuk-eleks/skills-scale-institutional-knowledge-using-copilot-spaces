# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's centralized project management documentation hub. This guide provides an overview of our project management processes and serves as a navigation center for all process documentation.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative project management approach emphasizing customer value, clear ownership, and data-driven decision making. The organization operates on core principles of customer-first prioritization, iterative delivery of small testable increments, and psychological safety that encourages feedback and learning. Projects follow a five-phase lifecycle: initiation (problem validation and stakeholder alignment), planning (breaking work into actionable backlogs), execution (build-test-review cycles), release (standardized deployment), and closure with retrospectives for continuous improvement.

The team structure revolves around three key personas with distinct responsibilities. Product Managers own the product vision, define success metrics, and prioritize roadmaps based on customer and business value. Project Managers coordinate delivery activities, manage risks and dependencies, facilitate meetings, and maintain transparent communication across stakeholders. Developers implement features to meet acceptance criteria, participate in code reviews, assist with planning estimates, and help identify technical risks.

Communication follows a regular cadence designed to maintain alignment and surface issues early. Teams conduct daily 15-minute standups focused on progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs to show progress and flag risks, and sprint/milestone demos. Project Managers provide weekly status updates to stakeholders using a standardized template covering progress, next steps, risks, and decisions needed. The escalation path flows from team-level triage during standups, to PM escalation to Product Leads and dependent teams, up to sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues.

Quality assurance is built into every stage of the workflow through comprehensive testing strategies and process controls. The development process requires unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, and end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows before release. All code goes through a pull request workflow with automated CI testing, security scanning, and at least one approval before merging. Projects maintain risk registers that are updated weekly, and teams conduct regular retrospectives after sprints, releases, or incidents to capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements with clear owners and timelines.

   - [Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)

4. **Learn communication protocols**: Read [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) to understand how we maintain alignment and escalate issues.

5. **Reference as needed**: Bookmark this page and refer back to specific guides as you work through different project phases.

### For Project Leaders

- Use these documents as templates and reference materials for your projects
- Keep project-specific documentation in your project repository
- Consider adding process-specific docs to `.copilot/` directories to provide context for Copilot Spaces
- Share relevant sections with stakeholders to align on processes and expectations

### Contributing to Documentation

If you identify gaps or improvements to these process documents:
- Discuss proposed changes with your Project Manager or Product Manager
- Follow the team's documentation review process
- Ensure updates maintain consistency across related documents
